# Pokedex
A Pokemon Pokedex for Pokemon fans hehe!!

Idea used - MySql-Python Connector

# ~__Information__~
**Pokedex** is a Battle Information Item often seen in Pokemon Anime and Games. It gives information on Pokemon (including their type, hp, attack, defense, spatk, spdefence, and speed).
Users need to search for Pokemon with their Pokemon ID.

# __How it works__
- Some Pokemon Stats are stored in the database by default.
- When the program is activated, the User will get a simple Menu (GPU to be added later when I learn it T T)
- The Menu will let the User choose whether to check any Pokemon using their ID or Enter the Pokemon details with their ID.
- The information is all added to the Database "pokedex_db" and Table "pokedex_info".

I am still working on it.So lets wait for updates !!

Enjoy !!
